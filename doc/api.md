# Back-end API specification

## End user API

For the user who check the coupon.

* No authentication is required for any API
* No user specific information is saved on back-end side
    * Any such data are saved on front-end with localStorage.

### GET recommended coupons

GET recommended coupons data for current user settings.

#### Sample request and response

Though the behavior of this API implies that it's better to use GET method, it might be good to use POST method to send this complex request with full JSON expression.

```bash
$ curl -G "http://$domain/api/v1/coupon" \
  --data-urlencode 'areas=[{"latitude": 41.40338, "longitude": 2.17403}]' \
  --data-urlencode 'tags=[4,6,8,9]' \
  --data-urlencode 'category=1' \
  --data-urlencode 'favorites=[2,50,230]' \
  --data-urlencode 'history=[430,2,220,50,22,300,230]' \
  | jq '.'

#### Request Parameter and its type

```haskell
-- Dummy data type representing request parameter from front-end
data RequestParam = RequestParam
  {
    -- Only coupons whose location is near by the any area
    -- specified by this parameter
    areas :: [Area]
    -- Tag IDs that the user chose as he/she is interested in
  , tags  :: [Tag]
    -- Category ID of coupons to show
  , category :: Category
    -- Coupon IDs that the user put it into favorite box
    -- The left side is the coupon ID that the user put it into for the last time
  , favorites :: [CouponId]
    -- Coupon IDs that the user has ever seen details
    -- For practical, the front-end will cut off only N newest history
    -- The left side is the coupon ID that the user saw for the last time
  , history :: [CouponId]
    -- This parameter is for infinite loading
    -- The response generate resulting list of coupons, and drops while this Coupon appears
    -- i.e., The first coupon id of response is this value
    -- If this value is `Nothing`, DO NOT drop coupons
  , next :: Maybe CouponId
    -- Response only returns first N of resulting lists,
    -- where N is the value specified by this
    -- If not specified, first 100 (default value) coupons are returned
  , limit :: Maybe Int
  }

```

#### Response and its type

This code is for explanation of the API response, so this is NOT the same structure as production code.

```haskell
-- Dummy data type representing response from back-end
data Response = Response
  {
    -- Next cursor of this search parameters
    -- i.e., To implement infinite scroll,
    --       the front-end send next request
    --       by setting this value on `next` parameter of request
    next :: Maybe CouponId
    -- Coupons matching request search parameters
  , coupons :: [Coupon]
  }

data Coupon = Coupon
  {
    -- An ID of this coupon
    couponId :: CouponId
    -- Information about the store that provide this coupon
  , couponStore :: Store
    -- An image for illustration purposes of the coupon
    -- If the image does not present, this returns default image
  , couponImage :: Image
    -- A title of this coupon
  , couponTitle :: Maybe Text
    -- The coupon can be used from this date
    -- Also, the coupon cannot be seen by end-user before this date
  , couponValidFrom :: Maybe UTCDate
    -- Expire date of this coupon
    -- After this date, the coupon does not appear in kucipong search result
    -- The store can reject the coupon, if an end-user show this coupon after the expire date
  , couponExpire :: Maybe UTCDate
    -- Coupon type
  , couponType :: CouponType

    -- ======== For `couponType` is `CouponDiscount` ========
    -- Percentage style discount rate about total fee
    -- i.e., (Actual fee) = (Total fee) * (100 - discountRate) `div` 100
  , discountRate :: Maybe PercentInt
    -- Minimum total fee to use this coupon
  , discountMinimumFee :: Maybe Int
    -- Other conditions to use this coupon
  , discountOtherConditions :: Maybe Text

    -- ======== For `couponType` is `CouponGift` ========
    -- Description about the gift
  , giftContent :: Maybe Text
    -- Reference price of the gift
  , giftReferencePrice :: Maybe Int
    -- Minimum total fee to use this coupon
  , giftMinimumFee :: Maybe Int
    -- Other conditions to use this coupon
  , giftOtherConditions :: Maybe Text

    -- ======== For `couponType` is `CouponSet` ========
    -- Description about the  set
  , setContent :: Maybe Text
    -- The  price of the set
  , setPrice :: Maybe Int
    -- Reference price of the  set
    -- i.e., The total fee to buy the same items without this coupon
  , setReferencePrice :: Maybe Int
    -- Other conditions to use this coupon
  , setOtherConditions :: Maybe Text

    -- ======== For `couponType` is `CouponOther` ========
    -- Desctiption about this coupon
