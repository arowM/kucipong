## Code Style

We use the default [`hindent`](https://github.com/chrisdone/hindent) style.
`hindent` is relatively new, and constantly changing, so we use the `master`
branch of `hindent`.

`hindent` generally sticks to the Johan Tibell style in the [Haskell Style
Guide](https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide/blob/master/haskell-style.md).

Some of the differences are as follows:

- 2-space indent
    - `hindent` uses 2-space indent instead of 4-space indent.
- imports
    - Future versions of `hindent` may change how [indents are
      formatted](https://github.com/chrisdone/hindent/pull/332). When [if] this
      happens, we will change our style as well.
